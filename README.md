This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in C++ related to the use of `std::vector<bool>`. While seemingly straightforward, `std::vector<bool>` is not a simple array of bits.  It's implemented differently for optimization purposes but can introduce unexpected overhead. This can be particularly problematic when dealing with large numbers of boolean values where performance is critical.  The example showcases the performance difference between `std::vector<bool>` and `std::bitset<N>` (where N is the number of boolean values).
